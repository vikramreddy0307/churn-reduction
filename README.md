# churn-reduction
Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for companies because it is moreexpensive to acquire a new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving.

This problem statement is targeted at enabling churn reduction using analytics concepts.

For this project we will be evaluating a dataset composed of human resources data.

Our objective is to build a model (or models) that predict whether or not an employee is likely to leave his/her job based on characteristics in the dataset. 


We should  develop an algorithm to predict the churn score based on usage
pattern. 
The predictors provided are as follows:

1.account length
2.international plan
3.voicemail plan
4.number of voicemail messages
5.total day minutes used
6.day calls made
7.total day charge
8.total evening minutes
9.total evening calls
10.total evening charge
11.total night minutes
12.total night calls
13.total night charge
14.total international minutes used
15.total international calls made
16.total international charge
17.number of customer service calls made

Target Variable :
move: if the customer has moved (1=yes; 0 = no
